# Interactive Periodic Table

This is a web-based interactive periodic table application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features:

-   **Colored Element Tiles:** Elements are color-coded based on their categories.
-   **Clickable Tiles:** Clicking an element tile triggers a smooth transition.
-   **Smooth Transitions:** The periodic table moves to the bottom, and the clicked element enlarges and centers on the screen.
-   **Informational Sidebar:** A sidebar appears on the right, displaying detailed properties of the selected element.
